# EDMOND-COMPANY-ATTRITION-REPORT
Edmond Company Employee Attrition Report (2023) is based on Understanding Workforce Dynamics, Well-being, and Strategic Retention through Data
About the Company & the Goal of the Report
Edmond Company is a mid-to-large scale organization with a workforce of 1,470 employees, operating in a range of departments from Sales and R&D to HR. As part of an internal effort to assess employee satisfaction, turnover, and retention challenges, this dashboard was designed to highlight the organizational dynamics influencing employee attrition. The goal was clear: uncover patterns, pinpoint red flags, and recommend data-backed strategies to reduce preventable turnover.

Pre-Analysis: The Strategic Framing
To create something meaningful, I didn’t just pull charts. I asked key diagnostic questions:
What are the demographic and behavioral patterns behind attrition?
Which departments or work habits are most vulnerable?
Is there a tie between work-life balance, job satisfaction, and resignations?
Can we spot attrition early enough to intervene?
These questions helped me clean and transform the raw data into actionable dimensions ,age, gender, department, travel, overtime, income, satisfaction levels, and marital status.
In-Analysis: What the Data Tells Us
Total Attrition: 237 employees That’s a 16% attrition rate, signaling concern. But who’s leaving and why?
Gender Disparity in Attrition
Males: 150
Females: 87
The gender gap suggests that male employees may be experiencing more turnover stress or dissatisfaction. This demands a closer look at role expectations, benefits, or managerial dynamics.
Marital Status Breakdown
Single employees lead attrition at 26%, compared to 12% (Married) and 10% (Divorced). Singles may lack work-life harmony or feel less rooted in company culture a wellness opportunity.

Overtime Effect
127 attritions occurred in employees who worked overtime, versus 110 who didn’t. This suggests burnout may be driving exits, especially if it's not matched with recognition or recovery time.
Business Travel Dynamics
A shocking insight: non-travelers account for 65.82% of attrition. It flips assumptions on their head , people not traveling are disengaging. Perhaps travel roles come with exposure, incentives, or flexibility that onsite staff don’t experience. 
Workplace Culture & Psychological Insights
Work-Life Balance & Job Involvement
The average job involvement score among those who left is 2.73, indicating lukewarm engagement.
Attrition is also clustered in departments like R&D and Sales, pointing to stress-heavy or under-supported environments.
The job satisfaction distribution leans toward scores 1–3, which means employees may feel under-recognized or underutilized.

Monthly Income Perspective
Interestingly, HR and Sales employees earn slightly more than R&D, yet R&D still shows higher attrition — suggesting that income isn’t the only currency. Growth, purpose, and well-being may weigh more heavily.
Final Observations
This report goes far beyond numbers. It paints a portrait of:

Mid-career employees, often unmarried, working overtime, with average income and job involvement, feeling the quiet erosion of engagement.

A potential retention crisis in departments where technical skill is high, but motivation and recognition lag behind.

Your dashboard becomes not just an HR tool, but a mirror for the company’s leadership culture, well-being policy, and communication dynamics.
Strategic Recommendations
 Implement Wellness & Flexibility Initiatives Offer flexible hours, remote work options, and scheduled recovery days — especially in R&D and Sales.
Mentor Programs for Single or Early-Career Staff Create workplace belonging for single employees via social programs, recognition pipelines, or mentorship.
Overtime Audit & Management Recognition Track managers whose teams have excessive overtime attrition. Reward performance, not endurance.
Rethink Non-Travel Roles Reevaluate the engagement, visibility, and opportunities offered to non-travel staff. Introduce job rotation or hybrid models.
 Embed Career Growth Conversations Job satisfaction scores suggest undercommunication. More frequent feedback loops can boost perceived value and commitment.

Why Power BI Worked for This Story
I chose Power BI for this project because of:
Dynamic filters (by gender, department, marital status) that personalize insights
Stacked and clustered bar charts for layered comparison
KPI cards to spotlight attrition intensity at a glance
Pie and doughnut visuals to express emotional trade-offs like stress vs satisfaction
Redefining Success in Workforce Analytics
In a business climate where retention is currency, success means knowing who’s at risk and why — before they walk out the door. This report puts data to work not just to measure loss, but to prevent it. And that, to me, is the mark of a people-first company.
